# A Secure and Lightweight PUF-based Three-Factor Authentication Protocol for Telehealthcare

This project implements a secure and lightweight three-factor authentication protocol for telehealthcare systems, based on the paper "A Secure and Lightweight PUF-based Three-Factor Authentication Protocol for Telehealthcare". The protocol enhances security and user authentication in healthcare data systems by utilizing PUF (Physical Unclonable Function).

## Project Overview

The proposed protocol leverages three-factor authentication to strengthen the security of telehealthcare systems. The main goal is to ensure consistency of session keys, prevent key leakage, and address session synchronization issues.

## ProVerif Code

The Registration Phase and Authentication and Key Exchange Phase of the protocol are implemented in ProVerif to verify the security properties. Using ProVerif, the protocol is validated for session key consistency, key leakage prevention, and session synchronization through specific queries.

## Key Features

- Enhanced security with Three-Factor Authentication.
- Strong security provided by PUF (Physical Unclonable Function)-based authentication.
- ProVerif-based security verification (session key consistency, key leakage prevention, session synchronization, etc.).
